This project is design of many different mode 
washing machine project with picsimlab , MPLAB X IDE and MPLAB XC Compiler
this project deign and development of the washing machine - in picsimlab

Purpose
This project focuses on simulating a washing machine using PicsimLab, aiming to replicate real-world washing machine functionality in a virtual environment. The project begins with a comprehensive understanding of washing machine components, cycles, and operations. Parameters defining laundry status, such as fabric type, load size, and water level, are identified.

Conclusion :
The washing machine simulation using picsimlab served as an effective tool for learning and applying concepts in embedded systems. It offered a hands-on experience that complemented theoretical knowledge and provided a foundation for further exploration in the field of automation and control systems.
